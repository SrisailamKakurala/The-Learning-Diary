In Python, variable names with underscores have specific meanings depending on their placement. Here's the distinction between variables with pre- and post-underscores:

1. Single Leading Underscore (_var)

Convention: This is a convention to indicate that a variable or method is intended for internal use within a class or module and should not be accessed directly. It is not enforced by Python, but it's a hint to other developers.

Example:

class MyClass:
    def _init_(self):
        self._internal_var = 42  # Internal use only


2. Single Trailing Underscore (var_)

Convention: This is used to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords or built-in names. For example, class_ instead of class because class is a reserved keyword in Python.

Example:

class_ = "A class name"


3. Double Leading Underscore (__var)

Purpose: This triggers name mangling, which is a technique that changes the name of the variable in a way that makes it harder to accidentally override or access the variable outside of its class. It is intended to make the variable more private.

Example:

class MyClass:
    def _init_(self):
        self.__private_var = 42  # Name mangling happens here

The variable _private_var is internally renamed to _MyClass_private_var.


4. Double Leading and Trailing Underscores (_var_)

Purpose: These are special methods (also known as "dunder" methods, short for "double underscore") in Python. These methods are predefined and used to define behavior for built-in Python operations like addition, string representation, etc.

Examples:

_init_(self) for the constructor method in a class.

_str_(self) for string representation of an object.

_add_(self, other) for addition of two objects.


You should avoid defining your own variables with double leading and trailing underscores unless you're implementing one of these special methods.


Summary:

Single underscores are for internal use (var or var).

Double leading underscores invoke name mangling to avoid accidental overriding (__var).

Double underscores on both sides are reserved for special, predefined methods that Python uses internally (_var_).


Thus, a variable like _var_ is different because itâ€™s intended for special use by Python, while variables with a single leading or trailing underscore are for convention or avoiding conflicts.
